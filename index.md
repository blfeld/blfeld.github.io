## About Me

I am a second-year MRes/Ph.D. student at LSE working both empirically and experimentally, and with a little bit of theory. I broadly focus on the organisation of work, and frequently find myself working with generative AI or studying its implications.

I am visiting **Berlin** during July and **Chicago** during the first half of August. I would love to meet up, especially if you are working on generative AI -- whether as a researcher, developer, or user.

## Research Interests

**Organisational Economics, AI**

## Work in Progress
**AI Psychotherapy**

**Generative AI and Team Organisation**
